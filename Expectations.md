## Goals

The goal of the Hayes group is to transform trainees into independent scientists capable of asking and answering their own scientific questions, while advancing computational protein design methods and applications.

## Values

There are several values the Hayes group seeks to instill: craftsmanship, curiosity, creativity, character, and charity. The research priorities of the Hayes group are centered on more accurate protein design methods, so high quality craftsmanship is even more important in this group than in others. Curiosity and creativity are essential for good science. Character is the integrity to do the right thing when it is inconvenient, and without it the scientific enterprise crumbles. Charity, or “benevolent goodwill toward or love of humanity,” is a catch-all term to describe that group members invest in and appreciate each other professionally and personally.

## Expectations

## Work

I expect students to work 40-50 hours per week. Less than 40 and you will make slow progress, more than 50 and productivity and enjoyment go down. This total includes coursework and TAing obligations, so if you are taking a class, the amount of time I expect you to spend on research goes down. Unless you're writing a paper, research is a team effort that is most effective in person, so I expect students to be in the office at least 11-4 on weekdays. (You can expect me to be in at least 9-4). I expect students to notify me in advance before vacation or working remotely while traveling.

## Academic Progress

Projects vary, but ideally graduate students will publish at least three first author papers during their time in the Hayes group. Students should also attend roughly one conference a year and present their research there.

## Aspirations

I aim to take trainees out to lunch at regular intervals, but as of 2024 this has only happened sporadically.

## Work in Progress

The values and policies of the Hayes lab are still being formed. If something is missing please suggest it.
