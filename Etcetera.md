## Conferences to consider attending

ACS - The American Chemical Society holds spring and fall meetings. These are very large conferences of around 10,000 chemists, so it’s very easy to get lost, but they almost always have interesting talks going if you can find them.

AIChE - The chemical engineering society has a similar meeting annually in November; I haven’t attended yet, so I can’t tell if it’s useful

Biophysical society - This is a medium size conference, maybe a couple thousand, usually in February, the topics are quite diverse, but I learned a lot about biophysics the first time I went here. It covers everything from molecular dynamics to structural determination to lipid rafts and liquid-liquid phase separation.

Protein society - This is a medium size conference of about 1200 scientists focused on proteins, everything from simulation to design to aggregation to folding, characterization, intrinsically disordered proteins and more. There are typically two sessions running at a time to choose between, and it runs at the end of June / beginning of July.

Gordon Research Conference on Protein Folding and Dynamics - There are many Gordon Research Conferences for different topics, held every other year with an attendance limit of 150 participants. They are very focussed on a narrow field, and this has been one of my favorite conferences since I first attended in 2010.

Free Energy Meeting - This conference occurs every other year and is focussed on computing free energies more accurately for big pharma applications in industry. Consequently, about half of the attendees are from industry. It’s capped around 200. On the off years they are trying to organize a similar conference in Europe.
